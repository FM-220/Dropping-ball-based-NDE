The simulation files and data from my master capstone: Resistive Memory-Based Analog Circuit Design for Neural Differential Equation Solving in Event Based Forecasting
The file of simulation data.xlsx includes the simulation data of position and velocity after integration. It is the hardware result of NDE prediction for the position trajectory and velocity changing trend. This data was not attached to the final report because it includes more than 10000 rows of data and would go beyond the page limit of 100.
